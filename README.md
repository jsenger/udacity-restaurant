## Installing

* Download this repository.
* Open the root folder in a terminal.
* Start a local HTTP server. To do this with Python, check the version you already have by typing `python -v` on the terminal. For Python 2.x, use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`. For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it on Python's website. In Windows systems Python 3.x is installed as `python`by default. To start a Python 3.x server, enter `python -m http.server 8000`.

## Running
After the installation, open the following link in your browser: http://localhost:8000.
